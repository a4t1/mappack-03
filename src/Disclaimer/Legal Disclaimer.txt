It is a common misconception that files on the internet are not subject to copyright laws, and may be used at will.  This is FALSE! 

"The general (and incorrect) notion is that anything that is on the internet is public domain and may be taken without permission from the creator/owner. Some people actually think (incorrectly) that just because bits of web pages may be stored in one's cache, or because certain browsers allow one to do "file save as" moves or anything similar one may use such material as you wish. These are false statements. Just because your backyard is not inside of your house, is it in the public domain? Does that give anybody off the street the right to step foot into your backyard without your permission, even if they can see it from the street, or easily access it? Well, the same applies to material published on the internet." 
Permission will usually be granted to use this map by asking the makers of the map.

This map was of course inspired by Southern France but with the addition of all new textures and various other subtle but fitting changes in layout.
The map went through many changes over the period of construction and we are now pleased to be able to release this finished verion for your enjoyment.
It is currently in TDM/Roundbased & FFA.
We could not have done this without the help from various map sites and a special mention goes to the helpful team and public at .map
This map is the first of many that we intend to build to make this great game even better,We hope you enjoy it.
Many thx Seere & Marax.
